- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jonelm01, Jonel Muncan.
- Iâ€™m currently interested in artificial intelligence, software engineering, game design, and other areas 
  of the field that may overlap with art or biology/psychology (such as robotics and prosthetics).
  
- Iâ€™m currently a "sophomore" in college but studying my first year of computer science at CUNY Hunter College. 
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any beginner-intermediate level projects in the sphere of computer science, or the arts.
